Sphinx
======

Sphinx_ is a documentation generator based on the reStructuredText (rst for
short) for short. It can be used to publish documentation on ReadTheDocs_ (see
:ref:`ReadTheDocs` chapter).

Installation
------------
Sphinx_ is written in Python. Follow the instructions in the
:ref:`Python Installation` section. This will install Python as well as Sphinx_
and related components.

.. Note::

    The installation is done in the ``ScribeEnv`` virtual environment.
    Make sure to execute the following command::

        workon ScribeEnv

    The shell prompt should then start with ``(ScribeEnv)`` meaning that
    you are working in the proper virtual environment.

Launching Sphinx
----------------


Documentation
-------------

An extensive documentation is available on the Sphinx_ and rst_ web sites. To
learn rst_ different kind of resources are probably better:

*   **Examples**.
    The best way to learn rst_ is probably to look at the source of
    existing rst texts. For instance on ReadTheDocs_ the documentation
    usually include a link ``View Code``.

*   **Cheat Sheets**
    Here is a list of cheat sheets ordered approximatively by size.

        * `CheatSheet #1`_
        * `CheatSheet #2`_
        * `CheatSheet #3`_
        * `CheatSheet #4`_
