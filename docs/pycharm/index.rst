=======

PyCharm_ is an excellent IDE for the Python language.

Overview
--------

Python being a dynamic language, using an IDE is a really good idea. This will
help you find errors at development time rather that at runtime. There are
various IDE for pythons around (see `python IDE comparison`_).

If you are going to write non trival python programs for some time, then
we recommend using PyCharm_. It will save you time. PyCharm_ is usually faster,
simpler and more powerful than PyDev_, the python environment on eclipse. If
you are really a huge fan of eclipse, you might prefer PyDev_ indeed.

Installation
------------
There are two versions:

* An open source version which is quite complete and very useful.
* A professional version which has support for django, databases, etc.

.. Attention::

    If you are student you can very easily get `PyCharm for students`_.
    You just need to register with the email of your university.

If you have access to the profession version that's fine. Otherwise, just use
the open source version. It is really worth anyway and you will probably not
see the difference for quite some time.

In practice you just have to go the `download PyCharm`_ page and then follow
the instructions. It should take or minute or so.
