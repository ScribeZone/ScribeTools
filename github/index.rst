Git(Hub)
========

Git_ is one of the most trendy Distributed Versioning Control System (DVCS)
especially in the context of open source projects. GitHub_, BitBucket_ and
GitLab_ are very popular hosting services on the cloud.

Overview
--------

It is important to clearly distinguish right from the beginning Git_ and
GitHub_/GitLab_.
Git_ is a general tool for versioning like SVN_. GitHub_, GitLab_ and
BitBucket_ are hosting services. They also provide tools (e.g. the GitHub
client) that can be installed locally on your machine.

Git
^^^

Git_ is a toolkit that can be used in a totally standalone mode, that is
locally on any kind of machine (e.g. a laptop running windows/linux/mac).
This is essentially a set of commands that you can run in a shell.

.. figure:: media/gitshell.jpg
    :align: Center

    A shell with a typical git command ``git status``

Git_ can be used both locally by a single developer but also locally and on
the web in a collaborative mode.

* git for local usage.
    One interesting aspect of Git_ is that it is file-based repository:
    installing it do not necessitate to install any kind of server, database;
    no daemon process is required, etc.
    Using git locally is therefore cheap and easy. It will just
    create a ``.git`` directory in your project directory and that's all. Full stop.
    Git_ can be useful really useful when working alone. This provides you
    some revision control for instance.

* git for collaborative usage.
    Obviously if the goal is to collaborate with others one need a
    *git server*. In this case the local copy of Git_ installed on your machine
    will serve as a *client*. You can setup a git server (if you are in a
    company) or reuse existing services from the cloud.

The next section is about git on the cloud.

GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to collaborate with others to develop an open source project,
GitHub_, GitLab_ or BitBucket_ are obvious solutions to consider, at least
if you plan to use Git_. They both provide hosting public git repositories
for free. GitHuh/GitLab/BitBucket have web-based interfaces to explore
repositories.

We highly recommend to use GitHub, unless if you need private repository.
If you want you can have a look at the article `bitbucket vs. github`_ or
to have a look at a more general `comparison of hosting services`_.

Here we will use GitHub since this is the most popular service.
Git also provides an excellent *git client* which is amazingly easy to use.

If you need to have a private repository, and want to have that for free,
then you have to use BitBucket for that repository. By contrast to Github
(which offer only public repository), BitBucket provide unlimited private
repositories (will a limit of 5 collaborators including you). The good news
is that tools work with any provider so the solution is most probably:
all public repositories on GitHub, all private repositories on BitBucket.

Installation
------------
In this section you will learn how to:

#. create a github account.
#. install the github client for your machine.
#. install a true 'git' toolkit (only if you need it).

Creating a GitHub account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Extremely simple. Just go to https://github.com/join and fill the various
fields. In step 2 select a free plan. Basically this is it.

.. figure:: media/github-join.jpg

    Joining GitHub - step 1

Installing the GitHub client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At the time of writing this documentation, nice github clients exist only for
Windows and for Mac. **This step is anyway not obligatory**. It installs
a nice graphical user interface for using git. This interface is really
cool, but if you really want to use only shell commands and have already
a git toolkit installed then you can skip this. If you are on linux you can
go to the next section.

Installation is really simple:

* for Windows just visit https://windows.github.com/ (windows installer
  |GithubClientWindows|).

    .. image:: media/github4windows.jpg

* for Mac just visit https://mac.github.com/ .

    .. image:: media/github4mac.jpg

Installing the BitBucket client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The github client is really easy to use. However if you want to learn more
about git and want to do some advanced things without the shell, the github
client is not the best choice. In fact, it hides some commands behind some
cool features like 'Sync'. You might prefer another client, for instance the
one proposed on BitBucket. This git client is called SourceTree.

.. figure:: media/BitBucketSourceTree.jpg

    SourceTree at work

Your can download it from the `SourceTree home page`_. It works on windows
and mac.

Using the git shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The github client installed in the previous sessions include not only a
graphical interface, but also give you access to a git shell where you
can type all commands.

.. figure:: media/github2shell.jpg
    :align: Center

    Launching a git shell from the Windows GitHub client

While the GUI is very nice and enough for most situations, sometimes you
will need to type git commands that are not available in the GUI. In this
case using the git shell is the solution.

.. _`Installing the git toolkit section`:

Installing the git toolkit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In some situations you will however have to install a git toolkit.

.. figure:: media/gitDownload.jpg
    :align: Center

    Git web site.

You have to install git:

* if you have not installed the GitHub client at all (either because you do
  not want or because it is not available on your platform).
* if you want to run some scripts with git commands but you cannot always
  run them from the GitHub shell (e.g. launching them from a cron tab).
* if you use some programs relying on the availability of git commands (those
  program will complain that git commands and not available).

In these case you will have to install git (possibly in addition to github
client). In order to do so, just `download git`_ and install
it following the instructions for your platform (e.g. for windows
|GitWindows|).

On Ubuntu you can install git as following (if it is not already installed)::

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa -y     # if you want the last version
    sudo apt-get update                             # if you want the last version
    sudo apt-get install git
    git --version


Configuration
-------------

If you use the command line, you should configure git. The option ``--global``
save the configuration in your ``.gitconfig`` home file. Otherwise you could
configure this for individual project.

Configure who you are (changing ``escribis`` by your github account)::

    git config --global user.name "escribis"
    git config --global user.email "escribis@users.noreply.github.com"

To avoid typing always your password (see `Caching you Github password`_)::

    git config --global credential.helper cache
    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

You may also configure (`Dealing with line endings`_)::

    git config --global core.autocrlf input    # if you use unix

Resources
---------

Cheat sheets
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   :download:`Git Cheat Sheet <docs/dist-GitCheatSheet-21.pdf>`:
    describes git at all levels of abstraction: trees, commits, branches,
    repositories, workflows.

    .. figure:: media/data_centric_cheatsheet.png
        :align: Center

*   `Commands GitHub Cheat Sheet`_:Â a cheat sheet listing classical
    git commands.

    .. figure:: media/github_cheat_sheet.png
        :align: Center

Visual resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   `Illustrated git`_: some nice illustrations. Not too much but the
    only guide starting right the blob level to the repository level.

    .. figure:: media/bloblevel.png
        :align: Center

*   `Git Visual Guide`_: a very nice guide displaying the commit graph
    resulting from the effect of a commands. Detailed and technical
    but a must read. The best in this kind of resources.

    .. figure:: media/git_visual_guide.png
        :align: Center

Interactive resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   `Git Interactive Cheatsheet`_: a interactive map showing 5 layers (
    stash / workspace / index / local repo/remote repo) and commands
    acting at each level.

    .. figure:: media/git_interactive_cheatsheet.png
        :align: Center

*   `Interactive git console`_: a nice interactive tutorial-like resource
    in the form a console that display commit graphs after each command
    is issued. Nice, but it misses some kind of guidance.

    .. figure:: media/interactive_git_console.png
        :align: Center


Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^

*   `Atlassian git tutorial`_: most probably the best git tutorial
    out there. A bit wordy, but it presents both concept and technical
    details with (almost) each commands involved. A quite nice comparison
    of workflows.

    .. figure:: media/atlassian_tutorial.png
        :align: Center



Workflows
---------


Resources
^^^^^^^^^

*   `Comparing workflows`_, from the `Atlassian git tutorial`_ is one of the
    best resource for understanding (some) workflows. It is a bit wordy, but
    still worths reading. Some part at the command level (not always detailed
    though).

    .. figure:: media/atlassian_comparing_workflow.png
        :align: Center

*   :download:`Visualizing git workflows <docs/GestionDeProduits-GitWorkflows-6.pdf/>`
    a set of slides comparing workflows.

    .. figure:: media/slides_git_workflow.png
        :align: Center

*   :download:`Workflow Cheat Sheet <docs/dist-GitCheatSheet-21.pdf>`:
    one page dedicated to the comparison of workflows.

    .. figure:: media/data_centric_cheatsheet.png
        :align: Center



Private workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* one local repo
* used for versioning a directory

Example::

    cd MyDir
    git init
    <changes>
    git add <files>
    git commit -m "<message>"
    <changes>
    git add <file>
    git commit -m "<message>"
    ...


Public workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* one local repo
* one remote repo
* used to share a project, to make the code public

Example::

    <github:creat repo>
    git clone <url>
    cd <dir>

    <changes>
    git add <files>
    git commit -m "<message>"
    <changes>
    git add <file>
    git commit -m "<message>"
    git push origin master
    ...
    git push origin master



Shared-master workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example::

    <github:creat repo>
    git clone <url>
    cd <dir>

    <changes>
    git add <files>
    git commit -m "<message>"
    ...
    git pull origin master              # to synch with remote master
    git push origin master              # to push all commit
    ...
    <changes again>
    ...

Feature branches workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creation of a new branch (f_color) from the master branch::

    # Create a new feature branch from master
    git checkout master             # enter the master branch
    git pull origin master          # get last master version
    git branch f_color              # create a new branch f_color
    git checkout f_color            # enter the new branch f_color

Regular modifications on f_color::

    ...
    <changes>                       # regular modifications on f_color
    git add <files>
    git commit -m "<message>"

Synch with remote repo from time to time::

    ...
    git push origin f_color         # f_color becomes a remote branch
    ...
    git pull origin master          # synchonize optionaly with master
    git push origin f_color         # push f_color again
    ...

At some point the branch f_color is good enough: create a pull request::

    <github:new pull request>       # button on github
    <github:discuss>                # discuss with others on github
    ...
    git commit -m "<message>"       # some improvement are required
    ...
    git pull origin master          # synch optionaly with master
    git push origin f_color         # push again to remote repo
    <github:discuss>                # discuss again with others

At some point the branch f_color is ready. Integration will take place
on github with the graphical interface.

After the integration it is best to remove the remote branch with the
"remote branch" button. Then the branch can be removed locally::

    git branch master
    git pull origin master
    git branch -d feature
